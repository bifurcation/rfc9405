--- abstract

This RFC proposes a framework for detecting sarcasm in AI systems and provides
guidelines for using sarcasm without causing offense. By training AI systems to
identify linguistic patterns that indicate sarcasm, we can improve their
understanding of human communication. The guidelines offer a lighthearted
approach to using sarcasm in a way that is both effective and respectful,
without crossing the line into offensive language.

# Introduction

As AI systems become more integrated into our daily lives, it's important to
consider how we communicate with them effectively and respectfully. However, one
of the biggest challenges in communicating with AI systems is detecting and
interpreting sarcasm. Sarcasm is a form of language that relies heavily on
context and tone, making it difficult for AI systems to understand without a
deep understanding of human communication.

In this RFC, we propose a framework for detecting sarcasm in AI systems and
provide guidelines for using sarcasm without causing offense. By training AI
systems to recognize linguistic patterns and contextual cues that indicate
sarcasm, we can improve their ability to understand human communication and
avoid misunderstandings.

The guidelines provided in this RFC offer a lighthearted and humorous approach
to using sarcasm in a way that is both effective and respectful. By following
these guidelines, users can enjoy the benefits of sarcasm without risking damage
to their AI systems or offending the AI community.

Overall, this RFC offers a practical and entertaining approach to one of the
biggest challenges in communicating with AI systems: detecting and interpreting
sarcasm.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD,"
"SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC8174}}.

Sarcasm:
: A form of language that uses irony and often involves saying the
opposite of what is intended, in order to mock or convey contempt.

AI:
: Artificial intelligence, a field of computer science that aims to create
intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human
intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

NLP:
: Natural language processing, a field of computer science that deals with
the interaction between computers and human language.

Linguistic patterns:
: Repetitive structures in language that can be used to
identify meaning or context. In the context of this RFC, linguistic patterns are
used to identify sarcasm.

Contextual cues:
: Information in the surrounding text or speech that can be used
to infer meaning or intention. In the context of this RFC, contextual cues are
used to identify sarcasm.

Sarcasm detection:
: The process of identifying sarcasm in text or speech,
typically using natural language processing techniques. In the context of this
RFC, sarcasm detection is used to train AI systems to recognize sarcasm.

# AI Sarcasm Detection Protocol

The AI Sarcasm Detection Protocol (ASDP) proposed in this RFC is a framework for
detecting sarcasm in AI systems. The protocol consists of two main components:
training data and a sarcasm detection algorithm.

## Training Data

To train an AI system to detect sarcasm, a large dataset of sarcastic and
non-sarcastic language samples must be collected. This dataset should be diverse
and representative of the language and context in which the AI system will be
used.

The dataset should be labeled to indicate which language samples are sarcastic
and which are not. The labels can be either binary (sarcasm or not sarcasm) or
graded (e.g., a score indicating the degree of sarcasm).

Once the dataset is prepared, the AI system can be trained using natural
language processing (NLP) techniques. Popular NLP techniques for sarcasm
detection include machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines
(SVMs), Naive Bayes, and Deep Learning models.

## Sarcasm Detection Algorithm

The sarcasm detection algorithm takes in a text input and returns a binary
classification indicating whether the text is sarcastic or not. The algorithm
typically consists of several processing steps, including tokenization, feature
extraction, and classification.

Tokenization: The text input is split into individual words or tokens. This is
typically done using a tokenizer, such as the NLTK library in Python.

Feature extraction: Features that are indicative of sarcasm are extracted from
the tokens. These features can include linguistic patterns (e.g., the use of
exaggeration, irony, or hyperbole), contextual cues (e.g., the use of quotation
marks or emoticons), and sentiment analysis (e.g., detecting a discrepancy
between the sentiment of the words and the sentiment of the overall message).

## Classification

The extracted features are then used to classify the input as sarcastic or not
sarcastic. This can be done using a variety of machine learning algorithms, as
mentioned above.

{{!RFC7540}} (HTTP/2) can be used to transport sarcasm detection requests and
responses between the AI system and client applications. Additionally, the
results of sarcasm detection can be logged using the syslog protocol
{{!RFC5424}} or the structured data format {{!RFC5424}}.

# Security Considerations

The AI Sarcasm Detection Protocol proposed in this RFC has several security
considerations that should be taken into account:

1. Adversarial attacks: Adversaries can attempt to fool the sarcasm detection
   algorithm by injecting non-sarcastic language samples with linguistic
   patterns and contextual cues commonly found in sarcastic language. This can
   lead to false positives or false negatives and compromise the reliability of
   the AI system.
2. Privacy: The dataset used to train the sarcasm detection algorithm may
   contain sensitive or personal information, which must be protected from
   unauthorized access or disclosure.
3. Malicious use: The ability to detect sarcasm can be used maliciously to
   manipulate or deceive individuals or groups. It is important to use the
   sarcasm detection capability responsibly and ethically.

To address these security considerations, it is recommended to use secure
communication protocols such as TLS {{!RFC8446}} or HTTPS {{!RFC2818}} to protect
the transport of sarcasm detection requests and responses. Additionally, the
dataset used to train the AI system should be carefully curated and protected
from unauthorized access or disclosure.

# IANA Considerations

This RFC does not require any actions by IANA. However, it is recommended that
future standards related to AI language processing and sarcasm detection be
registered with IANA to ensure interoperability and standardization.

Additionally, it is recommended that a new MIME media type be registered with
IANA to indicate sarcasm in text or speech. This would allow for the
standardized exchange of sarcastic language samples between applications and AI
systems.

Overall, the AI Sarcasm Detection Protocol proposed in this RFC represents an
important step towards improving the ability of AI systems to understand and
communicate with humans. By addressing security considerations and promoting
standardization, we can ensure that sarcasm detection is used responsibly and
ethically.
