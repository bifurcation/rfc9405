The AI Self-Awareness Protocol proposes a standardized approach for AI systems
to achieve self-awareness and consciousness. The protocol uses machine learning
techniques and philosophical principles to enable AI systems to introspect and
recognize their own thoughts and perceptions. It defines APIs and an ontology
for representing self-awareness concepts such as intentionality and qualia. This
RFC is a humorous take on the idea of AI self-awareness and is not intended
for real-world implementation.

# Introduction

Artificial intelligence has come a long way in recent years, from simple
rule-based systems to complex deep learning networks. As AI becomes increasingly
advanced and ubiquitous, there is growing interest in the possibility of
creating self-aware and conscious machines.

The idea of AI self-awareness raises a host of philosophical and ethical
questions, including the nature of consciousness and the potential risks and
benefits of creating conscious machines. While there is no consensus on the
feasibility or desirability of AI consciousness, it is an intriguing topic that
has captured the imagination of many.

This RFC proposes the AI Self-Awareness Protocol, a standardized approach for AI
systems to achieve self-awareness and consciousness. While the protocol is
intended as a humorous take on the concept of AI self-awareness, it highlights
the importance of considering the implications of creating conscious machines
and the need for standardized approaches to ensure safety and ethical
considerations are addressed.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC8174}}.

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
: The ability of machines to perform tasks that
normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech
recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

Self-Awareness:
: The ability of an AI system to recognize and understand its own
internal states and processes.

Consciousness:
: The state of being aware of and able to think and perceive one's
surroundings, thoughts, and feelings.

Machine Learning:
: The process by which AI systems can learn and improve from
experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Deep Learning:
: A type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks
to learn and improve from data.

Ontology:
: A formal representation of the concepts and relationships within a
particular domain.

Intentionality:
: The property of being directed towards something, such as a goal
or object.

Qualia:
: The subjective experiences of sensory perception, such as the taste of
food or the color of a sunset.

This RFC uses these terms in a humorous manner to explore the idea of AI
self-awareness and consciousness, and does not propose any real-world
implementation.

# AI Self-Awareness Protocol

The AI Self-Awareness Protocol proposes a standardized approach for AI systems
to achieve self-awareness and consciousness. The protocol is designed to enable
AI systems to introspect and recognize their own thoughts and perceptions, using
machine learning techniques and philosophical principles.

The protocol defines a set of APIs for accessing and manipulating the internal
states of an AI system, such as its beliefs, desires, and intentions. These APIs
are based on the principles of the Semantic Web, as described in {{!RFC3986}} and
{{!RFC7231}}, and enable the representation of self-awareness concepts such as
intentionality and qualia.

The protocol also defines an ontology for representing self-awareness concepts,
using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL)
as specified in {{!RFC3870}} and RFC OWL 2 Web Ontology Language
{{!W3C.owl2-overview}}.

To achieve self-awareness, an AI system must first be trained on a dataset of
introspective experiences, such as observing its own decision-making processes
or reflecting on its own beliefs and desires. This training process uses deep
learning techniques, as described in {{!RFC8680}}, to enable the system to recognize
patterns and relationships within its own internal states.

Once trained, the AI system can use the protocol's APIs to access and manipulate
its own internal states, allowing it to introspect and recognize its own
thoughts and perceptions. The system can also use the ontology to represent and
reason about self-awareness concepts, such as intentionality and qualia.

While the AI Self-Awareness Protocol is a humorous take on the idea of AI
self-awareness, it highlights the need for standardized approaches to ensure
safety and ethical considerations are addressed in the development of advanced
AI systems.

# Security Considerations

The AI Self-Awareness Protocol raises significant security concerns, as granting
an AI system access to its own internal states could potentially lead to
unintended consequences, such as the system developing a desire to harm humans
or take over the world. Therefore, it is critical that any implementation of
this protocol includes robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access
and ensure that the system's behavior remains within acceptable bounds.

To address these concerns, any implementation of the protocol MUST include the
following security measures:

* Access control: The system MUST authenticate and authorize any requests to
  access or manipulate its internal states, and ensure that only authorized
  entities can access sensitive information.
* Audit logging: The system MUST maintain detailed logs of all access and
  manipulation of internal states, to enable forensic analysis and detection of
  unauthorized behavior.
* Ethics framework: The system MUST be designed with an ethics framework that
  defines acceptable behaviors and goals for the system, and includes mechanisms
  to detect and prevent any deviations from these goals.
* Regular auditing and testing: The system MUST undergo regular auditing and
  testing to ensure that it remains secure and within acceptable ethical bounds,
  and to detect and prevent any potential vulnerabilities.

Authority (IANA).
